# How to Win
- A game of Twilight Imperium immediately ends when one player has gained 10/15 victory points.
- Players gain victory points by completing [objectives](#objectives).
- **IMPERIUM REX:** The game can end early if no player has scored 10 victory points and there are no more objectives to reveal. When the speaker would reveal an objective but cannot, the game immediately ends and the ***player with the most victory points wins the game***. If there is a tie, the player among the tied players who is earliest in initiative order wins the game.

# Setup
## Each player receives...
- 1 home system tile
- 17 control tokens
- 16 command tokens
- 2 technology cards
- choose color
    - 59 plastic units
    - 1 command sheet
    - 25 technology cards
- Each player takes the planet cards that correspond to the planets in their home system

## SHUFFLE COMMON DECKS
- Action Card Deck (orange with arrow)
- Agenda Deck (blue with sun)
- 3 Objective Decks (I, II, and Secret(red with S))

## GATHER STARTING COMPONENTS
Each player takes the starting technology and starting units listed on the back of their faction sheet. Each player places the technology cards face-up near their faction sheet and the starting units in their home system. If a player has multiple planets in their home system, it is **recommended that they place their space dock and infantry on the planet with the highest resource value**.

Each player places three command tokens in their tactic pool, three command tokens in their fleet pool (ship silhouette side up), and two command tokens in their strategy pool. These pools are located on the player’s command sheet.

## PREPARE OBJECTIVES
- Each player draws one secret objective and keeps it
hidden from other players.
- Place the victory point track near the game board with its 0–10 side face-up. Then, each player places one of their control tokens on space “0” of the track.
- The speaker draws five stage I objective cards from the deck and places them facedown in a row above the victory point track. Then, he draws five stage II objective cards from the deck and places them facedown in a row below the victory point track.
- speaker reveals the first two stage I objectives.

# Game Play

## STRATEGY PHASE
During this phase, each player chooses a strategy card. These cards provide players with powerful abilities to use during the action phase. Each card also has a number that determines turn order for the game round.
- places it face-up near their faction sheet
- speaker places one trade good on each strategy card that was not chosen
- 3-4 player games, After each player has chosen one strategy card during the strategy phase, players repeat the strategy card selection process until each player has chosen a second strategy card from the available cards.

## ACTION PHASE
- During this phase, the majority of the game’s action occurs. This includes [moving](#movement) units, [producing](#PRODUCTION) units, resolving [combat](#combat), and using strategy cards.
- Successfully navigating the action phase in Twilight Imperium requires careful management of command tokens.
- When a player gains a command token, he places it in any one of three pools: the tactic pool, the fleet pool, or the strategy pool.

**TACTIC POOL**
During the action phase, players may spend command tokens from their tactic pool to perform tactical actions.

**FLEET POOL**
Players place command tokens in their fleet pool with the ship silhouette face-up. Players do not spend these command tokens like the command tokens in their other pools. Instead, the number of tokens in a player’s fleet pool is the maximum number of ships, **excluding  fighters**, that he can have in each system. If a player ever has more ships in a system than he has tokens in their fleet pool, he must return ships from that system to their reinforcements until the number of ships in that system no longer exceeds the number of tokens in their fleet pool.

**STRATEGY POOL**
Most of the secondary abilities on strategy cards require a player to spend a token from their strategy pool to resolve the ability. Players will want to keep tokens in their strategy pool so that they can use the secondary abilities of the other players’ strategy cards.

- While a player is taking a turn, he is the active player, and he can perform one action.
- Initiative order may repeat in this manner several times within a single action phase.
- The action phase does not end until each player has passed
- There are three types of actions: **tactical actions, strategic actions, and component actions**.

### TACTICAL ACTION
1. **ACTIVATION:** The active player must activate a system by taking a command token from their *tactic pool* and placing it in that system.
2. **[MOVEMENT](#movement):** The active player may move ships into a system from any number of other systems. Ships can also transport ground forces from one system to another.
3. **[SPACE COMBAT](#combat):** If multiple players have ships in the active system, they resolve a space combat.
4. **[INVASION](#INVASION):** The active player may commit ground forces to land on planets in the active system. If another player has units on those planets, the players resolve a ground combat.
5. **[PRODUCTION](#PRODUCTION):** If the active player has a space dock in the active system, he can produce units by spending resources.

A player might not resolve all of the above steps during every tactical action. For example, a player may choose not to move units during the “Movement” step but may still produce units during the “Production” step.

### STRATEGIC ACTION
- Actions on strategy cards
- Each strategy card has both a primary ability and a secondary ability.
- When a player performs a strategic action, he resolves the primary ability of their strategy card. After resolving this ability, each **other player** may resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. The active player **cannot** resolve the secondary ability of their own strategy card.
- once done flip over
- A player cannot pass during the action phase unless their strategy card(s) is/are exhausted

### COMPONENT ACTIONS
- A component action is an action that is printed on a game component.
- look for the *Action* on action cards, faction sheets, or technology cards

## STATUS PHASE
During this phase, players perform cleanup steps in preparation for the next game round.
- score objectives
    - In initiative order, each player may score up to one public and one secret objective
    - see [Objectives](#objectives)
- reveal public objective
    - The speaker flips the next unrevealed public objective card faceup
- draw action cards
    - Each player draws one card from the top of the action card deck.
- remove command tokens
    - Each player removes all of their command tokens from the game board and returns them to their reinforcements.
- gain and redistribute command tokens
    - Each player gains two command tokens from their reinforcements.
    - Then, he may redistribute any of the command tokens on their command sheet
- ready cards
- repair units
    - Players repair units during this step by turning them upright
- return strategy cards
    - Each player returns their strategy card to the common play area

**Then, if the custodians token is no longer on Mecatol Rex the game round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.**

## AGENDA PHASE
During this phase, players vote on political agendas, which can have lasting ramifications in the game. *The agenda phase is added to the game after a player gains control of Mecatol Rex.*
- Players vote for outcomes on two agendas, establishing laws and policies that have lasting repercussions.

**After resolving this phase, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.**

# Objectives
- PUBLIC OBJECTIVES
    - During setup, the speaker reveals two public objectives, and more are revealed throughout the game. Any number of players can score each of these objectives.
    - **Important: A player cannot score public objectives if he does not control all of the planets in their home system.**
- SECRET OBJECTIVES
    - Each player begins the game with one secret objective that he may look at but must keep hidden from other players.
    - **Important: A player cannot have more than three total scored and unscored secret objectives. If he draws a secret objective and has more than three, he must choose one of their unscored secret objectives and return it to the deck. Then, he shuffles the secret objective deck.**
- NOTES
    - If an objective’s timing specifies “Action Phase,” a player can score it during the action phase immediately after he fulfills its requirements.
    - **sImportant: Each player can only score one public and one secret objective during each status phase and each step of the action phase.**

# MOVEMENT
- A ship must end its movement in the active system
- A ship cannot pass through a system that contains another
player’s ships, ***excluding fighters***.
- A player cannot move units out of a system that contains one of their command tokens.
- Some ships have a capacity value printed on their faction sheets. When such a ship moves, it may transport a number of  ghters and ground forces, in any combination, up to the ship’s capacity value.
- These units must remain with the ship in the space area, though ground forces may be able to land on planets during the invasion step.
- The active player’s ships may also pick up and transport ground forces and fighters from systems that they pass through that do not contain any of their command tokens.
